        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love having dessert for breakfast, because let's face it - that's basically what we're doing every morning we reach for that box of sugary cereal.  It provides virtually no nutritional value, and isn't very filling.  But I'll be darned if it isn't oh-so-delicious.  So let's dive in to how you can prepare your own little bowl filled with little sweet morsels.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A bowl and spoon</li>
            <li>Milk, any brand or type</li>
            <li>Box of cereal, any brand (stay away from ones high in fiber or low in sugar...bleh)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill bowl with cereal</li>
            <li>Pour milk until bowl is 1/2 - 2/3 full</li>
            <li>Grab spoon and devour</li>
        </ol>
